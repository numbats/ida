# Environment
# You can create new objects with `<-`:
x <- 3 * 4

# Check your environment pane is there an object called `x`?
# You can inspect an object by typing its name (in the console pane):
x

# Let's make another object:
r_rocks <- 2 ^ 3

# Now inspect it:
r_rock

# Oops, try again:
R_rocks

# R is very picky!
# Thereâ€™s an implied contract between you and R: it will do the tedious computation for you, but in return, you must be completely precise in your instructions. Typos matter. Case matters.

# R Functions
# Functions are (most often) verbs, followed by what they will be applied to in parentheses:
do_this(to_this)
do_that(to_this, to_that, with_those)

# Packages are installed with the `install.packages` function and loaded with the `library` function, once per session:
# CRAN
# Centralised

# Archive
# Network

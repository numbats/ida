# Recap on some tricky topics

- pipes `%>%` ("then")
- assignment `<-` ("gets")

---
# The pipe operator: `%>%`

- Code to tell a story about a little bunny foo foo (borrowed from https://r4ds.had.co.nz/pipes.html):
- Using functions for each verb: `hop()`, `scoop()`, `bop()`.

> Little bunny Foo Foo
Went hopping through the forest
Scooping up the field mice
And bopping them on the head

---
# Approach: Intermediate steps

```r
foo_foo_1 <- hop(foo_foo, through = forest)
foo_foo_2 <- scoop(foo_foo_1, up = field_mice)
foo_foo_3 <- bop(foo_foo_2, on = head)
```

- Main downside: forces you to name each intermediate element. 
- Sometimes these steps form natural names. If this is the case - go ahead.
- **But many times there are not natural names**
- Adding number suffixes to make the names unique leads to problems. 

---
# Approach: Intermediate steps

```r
foo_foo_1 <- hop(foo_foo, through = forest)
foo_foo_2 <- scoop(foo_foo_1, up = field_mice)
foo_foo_3 <- bop(foo_foo_2, on = head)
```
- Code is cluttered with unimportant names
- Suffix has to be carefully incremented on each line.
- I've done this! 
- 99% of the time I miss a number somewhere, and there goes my evening ... debugging my code.

---
# Another Approach: Overwrite the original

```r
foo_foo <- hop(foo_foo, through = forest)
foo_foo <- scoop(foo_foo, up = field_mice)
foo_foo <- bop(foo_foo, on = head)
```

- Overwrite originals instead of creating intermediate objects 
- Less typing (and less thinking). Less likely to make mistakes?
- **Painful debugging**: need to re-run the code from the top.
- Repitition of object - (`foo_foo` written 6 times!) Obscures what changes.

---
# (Yet) Another approach: function composition

```r
bop(
  scoop(
    hop(foo_foo, through = forest),
    up = field_mice
  ), 
  on = head
)
```

- You need to read inside-out, and right-to-left.
- Arguments are spread far apart
- Harder to read

---
# Pipe `%>%` can help!

.pull-left[
`f(x)` 

`g(f(x))`

`h(g(f(x)))`
]

--

.pull-right[
`x %>% f()`

`x %>% f() %>% g()`

`x %>% f() %>% g() %>% h()`
]

---
# Solution: Use the pipe - `%>%`


```r
foo_foo %>%
  hop(through = forest) %>%
  scoop(up = field_mice) %>%
  bop(on = head)
```

- focusses on verbs, not nouns. 
- Can be read as a series of function compositions like actions. 

> Foo Foo hops, then scoops, then bops.

# Assignment `<-`

"gets"

---
# Assignment

We can perform calculations in R:

```r
1 + 1
read_csv("data.csv")
```

---
# Assignment

But what if we want to use that information later?

```r
1 + 1
read_csv("data.csv")
```

---
# Assignment

We can assign these things to an object using `<-`

This reads as "gets".

```r
x <- 1 + 1
my_data <- read_csv("data.csv")
```

--

- x 'gets' 1+1
- my_data 'gets' the output of read_csv...
---
# Assignment

Then we can use those things in other calculations

```r
x <- 1 + 1
my_data <- read_csv("data.csv")

x * x

my_data %>% 
  select(age, height, weight) %>% 
  mutate(bmi = weight / height^2)
```

# Why look at audio data?

- Data comes in many shapes and sizes
- Audio data can be transformed ("rectangled") into a data.frame
- Another type of data is data on the web.
- Extracting data from websites is called "web scraping". 

---
# Scraping the web: what? why?

- Increasing amount of data is available on the web.
- These data are provided in an unstructured format: you can always copy&paste, but it's 
time-consuming and prone to errors.
- Web scraping is the process of extracting this information automatically and transform it into 
a structured dataset.

---
# Scraping the web: what? why?


1. Screen scraping: extract data from source code of website, with html parser (easy) or regular expression matching (less easy).
2. Web APIs (application programming interface): website offers a set of structured http  requests that return JSON or XML files.
- Why R? It includes all tools necessary to do web scraping, familiarity, direct analysis of data... But python, perl, java are also efficient tools.

# Web Scraping with `rvest` and `polite`

---
# Hypertext Markup Language

Most of the data on the web is still largely available as HTML - while it is structured (hierarchical / tree based) it often is not available in a form useful for analysis (flat / tidy).

```html
<html>
  <head>
    <title>This is a title</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p align="center">Hello world!</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

---
# What if we want to extract parts of this text out?

```html
<html>
  <head>
    <title>This is a title</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p align="center">Hello world!</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

--

- `read_html()`: read HTML in (like `read_csv` and co!)

--

- `html_nodes()`: select specified nodes from the HTML document using CSS selectors.

---
# Let's read it in with `read_html`

```{r read-html}
example <- read_html(here::here("slides/data/example.html"))
example
```

--

- We have two parts - head and body - which makes sense:

```html
<html>
  <head>
    <title>This is a title</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p align="center">Hello world!</p>
  </body>
</html>
```



---
# Now let's get the title

```{r read-html-title}
example %>% 
  html_nodes("title")
```

--

```html
<html>
  <head>
    <title>This is a title</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p align="center">Hello world!</p>
  </body>
</html>
```


---
# Now let's get the paragraph text

```{r read-html-para}
example %>% 
  html_nodes("p")
```

--

```html
<html>
  <head>
    <title>This is a title</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p align="center">Hello world!</p>
  </body>
</html>
```


---
# Rough summary

- `read_html` - read in a html file
- `html_nodes` - select the parts of the html file we want to look at
    - This requires knowing about the website structure
    - But it turns out website are much...much more complicated than out little example file

---
class: transition
# rvest + polite: 

Simplify processing and manipulating HTML data

- `bow()` - check if the data can be scraped appropriately
- `scrape()` - scrape website data (with nice defaults)
- `html_nodes()` - select specified nodes from the HTML document using CSS selectors.
- `html_table` - parse an HTML table into a data frame.
- `html_text` - extract tag pairs' content.

---
# SelectorGadget: css selectors

- Using a tool called selector gadget to **help** identify the html elements of interest
- Does this by constructing a css selector which can be used to subset the html document.

# SelectorGadget

- SelectorGadget: Open source tool that eases CSS selector generation and discovery
- Install the [Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/selectorgadget/mhjhnkcfbdhnjickkkdbjoemdmbfginb) 
- A box will open in the bottom right of the website. Click on a page element 
that you would like your selector to match (it will turn green). SelectorGadget 
will then generate a minimal CSS selector for that element, and will highlight 
(yellow) everything that is 
matched by the selector. 
- Now click on a highlighted element to remove it from the selector (red), or 
click on an unhighlighted element to add it to the selector. Through this process 
of selection and rejection, SelectorGadget helps you come up with the appropriate 
CSS selector for your needs.

- Add a variable for rank

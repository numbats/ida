**Q - What data analysis background does this course assume?**  

A - None.

--

**Q - Is this an intro stat course?**  
A - Statistics `\(\ne\)` data science. BUT they are closely related. This course is a great way to get started with statistics. But is **not** your typical high school statistics course.

--

**Q - Will we be doing computing?**   
A - Yes.

# What is R? 

.blockquote[
R is a language for data analysis. If R seems a bit confusing, disorganized, and perhaps incoherent at times, in some ways that's because so is data analysis.

-- Roger Peng, 12/07/2018
]

---
# Why R?

- __Free__
- __Powerful__: Over 14600 contributed packages on the main repository (CRAN), as of July 2019, provided by top international researchers and programmers. 
- __Flexible__: It is a language, and thus allows you to create your own solutions
- __Community__: Large global community friendly and helpful, lots of resources

# Create your first data visualisation

- Once you log on to RStudio Cloud, click on this course's workspace "ETC1010 2020 semester 1"
- You should see a project called "UN Votes", click on the xx icon. This will create a copy of the project, and launch it.
- In the Files pane in the bottom right corner, open the file called `unvotes.Rmd`. Then click on the "Knit" button.
- Go back to the file and change your name on top (in the `yaml` -- we'll talk about what this means later) and knit again.
- Change the country names to those you're interested in. Spelling and capitalization should match the data so take a peek at the Appendix to see how the country names are spelled. Knit again. And voila, your first data visualization!

# What you need to learn

Data preparation accounts for about 80% of the work of data scientists

## Data Preparation

* One of the least taught parts of data science, and business analytics, and yet it is what data scientists spend most of their time on. 
* By the end of this semester, you will have the tools to be more efficient and effective in this area, so that you have more time to spend on your mining and modeling.

---

# Learning objectives

The learning goals associated with this unit are to:

1. Learn to read different data formats, learn about tidy data and wrangling techniques
2. Apply effective visualisation and modelling to understand relationships between variables, and make decisions with data
3. Develop communication skills using reproducible reporting.

# MoVE unit

You can use the rstudio cloud server.

In the future we will have R and Rstudio installed locally.

When this happens, you can use USB stick, attach to the borrowed laptop, and install R, RStudio and all your packages on this. Use can then use the USB stick as your working environment, with the borrowed laptop simply as the computing engine.

# Tips for asking questions

- First search existing discussion for answers. If the question has already been answered, you're done! If it has already been asked but you're not satisfied with the answer, add to the thread. 

--

- Give your question context from course concepts not course assignments.
    - Good context: "I have a question on filtering data"
    - Bad context: "I have a question on Assignment 1"

---
# Tips for asking questions

- Be precise in your description:
    - Good description: "I am getting the following error and I'm not sure how to resolve it - `Error: could not find function "ggplot"`"
    - Bad description: "R giving errors, help me! Aaaarrrrrgh!" 
- Remember: you can edit a question after posting it.

#  Diversity &amp; Inclusiveness:

- Intent: Students from all diverse backgrounds and perspectives be well-served by this course, that students' learning needs be addressed both in and out of class, and that the diversity that the students bring to this class be viewed as a resource, strength and benefit. 

- It is my intent to present materials and activities that are respectful of diversity: gender identity, sexuality, disability, age, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, race, nationality, religion, and culture. Let me know ways to improve the effectiveness of the course for you personally, or for other students or student groups.

---
# Diversity &amp; Inclusiveness:

- If you have a name and/or set of pronouns that differ from those that appear in your official Monash records, please let me know!

- If you feel like your performance in the class is being impacted by your experiences outside of class, please don't hesitate to come and talk with me. I want to be a resource for you. If you prefer to speak with someone outside of the course, talk to Di Cook, or look at the services available to you in the [Monash student support services](https://www.monash.edu/students/support). 

---
# Diversity &amp; Inclusiveness:

- I (like many people) am still in the process of learning about diverse perspectives and identities. If something was said in class (by anyone) that made you feel uncomfortable, please talk to me about it.

---

# Sharing / Reusing code

- I am well aware that a huge volume of code is available on the web to solve any number of problems.
- Unless I explicitly tell you not to use something the course's policy is that you may make use of any online resources (e.g. StackOverflow) but you must explicitly cite where you obtained any code you directly use (or use as inspiration). This can be as simple as pasting the link in a references section.

---

# Sharing / Reusing code

- Any recycled code not explicitly cited will be treated as plagiarism. 
- Assignment groups may not directly share code with another group. 
- You are welcome to discuss the problems together and ask for advice, but you may not make direct use of code from another team.


---

# Group Assignments

What we expect:

- Conducted according to the [Monash policies](https://www.monash.edu/__data/assets/pdf_file/0011/1098659/Team-Assessment-Guidelines.pdf). 

- Each member of the group completes the entire assignment, as best they can.
- Group members compare answers and combine it into one document for the final asubmission. 
- 25% of the assignment grade will come from peer evaluation. 
- Peer evaluation is an important learning tool. 

---

# Group Assignments: Peer evaluation

Each student will be randomly assigned another team's submission to provide feedback on three things: 

  1. Could you reproduce the analysis? 
  2. Did you learn something new from the other team's approach?
  3. What would you suggest to improve their work?

---

# Group Assignments: Working in groups

- Conflicts can arise in group work.

--

- They can be both productive and destructive. 

--

- Teams need to work on managing conflicts and building on the strengths of all team members. 

---

# Group Assignments: Working in groups

- For each assignment, you will be given the option to comment on the efforts of your other group members. 

--

- If a team member has not contributed to an assignment submission, they might score a 0. 

--

- In this situation the team will need to discuss team function and dysfunction with the instructor.

# What is R/RStudio?

- R is a statistical programming language

- RStudio is a convenient interface for R (an integrated development environment, IDE)

.blockquote[
If R were **an airplane**, RStudio would be **the airport**, providing many, many supporting services that make it easier for you, the pilot, to take off and go to awesome places. Sure, you can fly an airplane without an airport, but having those runways and supporting infrastructure is a game-changer

- __Source code editor__: This is where you edit your script! Experiment with writing your data analysis pipeline, ... You can have multiple files open, there are useful shortcuts (eg "Run", "Knit"), code is highlighted usefully and there is tab-completion when you start typing. *Also, if you want to look at any of the data you have read or created, it can be viewed in a tab on this pane.*
- __Console window__: This is where the code is executed. There is a prompt "&gt;" which says *R is waiting for your command*. You don't actually need to type anything in this pane, you can run code directly from the Editor pane. The functions will show up in this window, and the results will be here. (Although, if you use an R notebook the result will show up in that notebook.)
- __Help__: *?function* will show the help pages for the function here.
- __Plot__: Plots you ask R to make will show up here, and you can zoom to make them bigger in a separate window if you want.
- __Environment__: Data that you have read into R, or data or functions that you create will be listed here. **When you quit R, you will be asked if you want to save the environment. I suggest that you always answer NO.** Because we are scripting everything it is always easy to re-create the objects in the environment. The only time it can be useful is if you have created something that took a while, but a better option is to save this object to a file, and read it in at the start of the next R session.

# R essentials: A short list (for now)

- Functions are (most often) verbs, followed by what they will be applied to in parentheses:


```r
do_this(to_this)
do_that(to_this, to_that, with_those)
```

--

For example:

--

.hacker-type[

```r
mean(c(1,2,1,2))
## [1] 1.5
```
]

---
# R essentials: A short list (for now)


- Columns (variables) in data frames are accessed with `$`:


```r
dataframe$var_name
```

--

For example:

--
.hacker-type[

```r
starwars$name
##  [1] "Luke Skywalker"        "C-3PO"                 "R2-D2"

### Cheatsheets

RStudio started a trend by writing really concise summaries, and others have added to the collection. You can find the RStudio collection in the "Help" menu on the IDE, and at https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/. 

Start with the [RStudio IDE cheatsheet](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/rstudio-ide.pdf). 

### Using the IDE

- __Source code editor__: This is where you edit your script! Experiment with writing your data analysis pipeline, ... You can have multiple files open, there are useful shortcuts (eg "Run", "Knit"), code is highlighted usefully and there is tab-completion when you start typing. *Also, if you want to look at any of the data you have read or created, it can be viewed in a tab on this pane.*
- __Console window__: This is where the code is executed. There is a prompt "&gt;" which says *R is waiting for your command*. You don't actually need to type anything in this pane, you can run code directly from the Editor pane. The functions will show up in this window, and the results will be here. (Although, if you use an R notebook the result will show up in that notebook.)
- __Help__: *?function* will show the help pages for the function here.
- __Plot__: Plots you ask R to make will show up here, and you can zoom to make them bigger in a separate window if you want.
- __Environment__: Data that you have read into R, or data or functions that you create will be listed here. **When you quit R, you will be asked if you want to save the environment. I suggest that you always answer NO.** Because we are scripting everything it is always easy to re-create the objects in the environment. The only time it can be useful is if you have created something that took a while, but a better option is to save this object to a file, and read it in at the start of the next R session.

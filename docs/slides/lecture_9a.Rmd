# Announcements

- Project deadlines:
  - **Deadline 2 (22nd May) **:  Team members and team name, data description.
  - **Deadline 3 (29th May) **:  Electronic copy of your data, and a page of data description, and cleaning done, or needing to be done.
- Practical exam.

class: refresher

# recap: Last week on tidy text data

# Network analysis

**A description of phone calls**

- Johnny --> Liz
- Liz --> Anna
- Johnny -- > Dan
- Dan --> Liz
- Dan --> Lucy

---
# As a graph

```{r make-call-graph, echo = FALSE}

# And as an association matrix

[DEMO]

---
# Why care about these relationships?

- **Telephone exchanges**: Nodes are the phone numbers. Edges would indicate a call was made betwen two numbers.
- **Book or movie plots**: Nodes are the characters. Edges would indicate whether they appear together in a scene, or chapter. If they speak to each other, various ways we might measure the association.
- **Social media**: nodes would be the people who post on facebook, including comments. Edges would measure who  comments on who's posts.

---
# Drawing these relationships out:

One way to describe these relationships is to provide association matrix between many objects. 

```{r draw-association, echo = FALSE, out.width = "80%"}

# Generate a network view

- Create a layout (in 2D) which places nodes which are most related close,
- Plot the nodes as points, connect the appropriate lines
- Overlaying other aspects, e.g. gender

---
# introducing `madmen` data

```{r make-madmen-graph}
glimpse(madmen)
```

---
# Nodes and edges?

Netword data can be thought of as two related tables, **nodes** and **edges**:

- **nodes** are connection points
- **edges** are the connections between points

---
# Example: Mad Men. (Nodes = characters from the series)

```{r mm-nodes}
madmen_nodes
```

---
# Example: Mad Men. (Edges = how they are associated)

```{r mm-edges}
madmen_edges
```

---
# Let's get the madmen data into the right shape

```{r}
madmen_edges %>%
  rename(from_id = Name1, to_id = Name2) 
```

---
# Let's get the madmen data into the right shape

```{r}
madmen_net <- madmen_edges %>%
  rename(from_id = Name1, to_id = Name2) %>%
  full_join(madmen_nodes,  #<<
            by = c("from_id" = "label")) #<<

madmen_net
```

---
# Full join?

```{r full-join-gif, echo = FALSE, out.width = "60%"}
include_graphics("gifs/full-join.gif")
```

---
# Plotting the data with `geomnet`

```{r ggraph-madmen, echo = FALSE, fig.width = 10, fig.height = 5}
# create plot
set.seed(5556677)
ggplot(data = madmen_net, aes(from_id = from_id, to_id = to_id)) +
  geom_net(aes(colour = gender), layout.alg = "kamadakawai",
    size = 2, labelon = TRUE, vjust = -0.6, ecolour = "grey60",
    directed =FALSE, fontsize = 3, ealpha = 0.5) +
    scale_colour_manual(values = c("#FF69B4", "#0099ff")) +
    xlim(c(-0.05, 1.05)) +

# Example: American college football


Fall 2000 Season of [Division I college football](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_Division_I). 
- Nodes are the teams, edges are the matches. 
- Teams are broken into "conferences" which are the primary competition, but they can play outside this group.

---
# What do we learn?

- Remember layout is done to place nodes that are more similar close together in the display. 
- The colours indicate conference the team belongs too. For the most part, conferences are clustered, more similar to each other than other conferences. 
- There are some clusters of conference groups, eg Mid-American, Big East, and Atlantic Coast
- The Independents are independent
- Some teams play far afield from their conference.

# Summary

- To make a network analysis, you need:

- an association matrix, that describes how nodes (vertices) are connected to each other
- a layout algorithm to place the nodes optimally so that the fewest edges cross, or that the nodes that are most closely associated are near to each other.

- Complete  9a-class.Rmd
- Read in last semesters class data, which contains `s1_name` and `s2_name` are the first names of class members, and tutors, with the latter being the "go-to" person for the former. 
- Write the code to produce a class network that looks something like the plot on the right.

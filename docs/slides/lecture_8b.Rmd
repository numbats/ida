# Interaction between quantitative and categorical variables

- An interaction term is needed in a model if the linear relationship is different for the response vs quantitative variable for different levels of the categorical variable. 
- That is, a different *slope* needs to be used/estimated for each level. 

---
# Interaction between quantitative and categorical variables

- Let's take a look at how this works for the [2015 OECD PISA data](http://www.oecd.org/pisa/data/2015database/).
- The question to be answered is whether more time spent studying science is associated with higher science scores, and how this varies with enjoyment of science.

---
# PISA data

```{r print-pisa}
pisa_au <- read_csv("data/pisa_au.csv")
pisa_au
```

---
# PISA data

```{r show-specific-pisa}
pisa_au %>%
  select(science_time,
         science,
         science_fun)
```

---
# Interaction between quantitative and categorical variables


```{r read-pisa, echo=FALSE}

library(labelled)
pisa_au_science <- pisa_au %>% 
  filter(science_fun < 5) %>%
  filter(!is.na(science_time)) %>% 
  select(science, 
         science_fun, 
         science_time, 
         stuweight) %>%
  mutate(science_fun = to_factor(science_fun, 
                                 ordered = TRUE, 
                                 drop_unused_labels = TRUE)) %>%

# There are two possible models:

$y_i = \beta_0+\beta_1x_{i1}+\beta_2x_{i2}+\varepsilon_i$ (Model 1)

$y_i = \beta_0+\beta_1x_{i1}+\beta_2x_{i2}+\beta_3x_{i1}*x_{i2}+\varepsilon_i$ (Model 2)

- $y=$ science score
- $x_1=$ science study time
- $x_2=$ science enjoyment. 

Model 2 has an interaction term.  This means that the slope will be allowed to vary for the different levels of the categorical variables, science_fun.

---
# Note on modelling

*Note:* Ordered factors are treated as "numeric" in the default model fit, so we should convert `science_fun` to be an unordered categorical variable. Also, `science_time` is heavily skewed so should be transformed.

---

```{r pisa-science}
pisa_au_science_log10 <- pisa_au_science %>%
  mutate(log_science_time = log10(science_time)) %>%
  mutate(science_fun_c = factor(science_fun, ordered = FALSE))

mod1 <- lm(science ~ log_science_time + science_fun_c, #<<
           data = pisa_au_science_log10, 
           weights = stuweight)

mod2 <- lm(science ~ log_science_time * science_fun_c, #<<
           data = pisa_au_science_log10, 
           weights = stuweight)
```

---

```{r pisa-science-show}
tidy(mod1)
tidy(mod2)
```

---
# Five minute challenge

- Write out the equations for both models. (Ignore the log transformation.)
- Make a **hand** sketch of both models.

---
# Which is the better model?

```{r glance-models}
glance(mod1)
glance(mod2)
```

`r emo::ji("shocked")` they are both pretty bad! The interaction model (mod2) is slightly better but its really not.

---
# Five minute challenge

Using the PISA data: How does science score relate to text anxiety and gender?

- Make a plot of science by anxtest, coloured by gender. Does it look like an interaction term might be necessary?
- Try an interaction between gender and anxtest. 
- Which is the better model?

```{r cd-five}
library(countdown)
countdown(minutes = 5)

# Model building, Goal:

The simplest model possible that provides similar predictive accuracy to most complex model.

---
# Model building, Approach:

- Start simply, fit main effects models (single best variable, adding several more variables independently) and try to understand the effect that each has in the model. 
- Explore transformations with the aim to build a stable foundation of explanatory variables for the model.
- Check model diagnostics, residual plots.
- Explore two variable interactions, and understand effect on model.
- Explore three variable interactions.
- Use model goodness of fit to help decide on final. There may be more than one model that are almost equally as good.

---
# Some asides on model building

- Ideally, values of explanatory variables cover all possible combinations in their domain. 
- There should *not be any association between explanatory variables*. 
- If there is, then the there is more uncertainty in the parameter estimates. 
- Its like building a table with only two legs, that table would be a bit wobbly, and unstable. 

---
# Some asides on model building

- A work around is to first regress one explanatory variable on the other, and add the residuals from this fit to the model, instead of the original variable. 
- That is, suppose $X_1, X_2$ are strongly linearly associated, then model $X_2\sim b_0+b_1X_1+e$, and use $e$ (call it $X^*_2$) in the model instead of $X_2$. 
- You would then only be using the part of $X_2$ that is not related to $X_1$ to expand the model. 
- This approach can be used for multiple explanatory variables that are associated.

# Your Turn:

Build the best model you can for science scoreby exploring  these variables: 

- math score
- reading score
- tvs
- books
- breakfast

Feel free to choose others. (Code provided in exercise is just a sample, and needs to be modified.)

# Sentiment analysis

Sentiment analysis tags words or phrases with an emotion, and summarises these, often as the positive or negative state, over a body of text. 

---
# Sentiment analysis: examples

- Examining effect of emotional state in twitter posts
- Determining public reactions to government policy, or new product releases
- Trying to make money in the stock market by modeling social media posts on listed companies
- Evaluating product reviews on Amazon, restaurants on zomato, or travel options on TripAdvisor

---
# Lexicons

The `tidytext` package has a lexicon of sentiments, based on four major sources: [AFINN](http://www2.imm.dtu.dk/pubdb/views/publication_details.php?id=6010), [bing](https://www.cs.uic.edu/~liub/FBS/sentiment-analysis.html), [Loughran](https://sraf.nd.edu/textual-analysis/resources/#LM%20Sentiment%20Word%20Lists), [nrc](http://saifmohammad.com/WebPages/NRC-Emotion-Lexicon.htm)

---
# emotion

What emotion do these words elicit in you?

- summer
- hot chips
- hug
- lose
- stolen
- smile

---
# Different sources of sentiment

- The `nrc` lexicon categorizes words in a binary fashion ("yes"/"no") into categories of positive, negative, anger, anticipation, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise, and trust. 
- The `bing` lexicon categorizes words in a binary fashion into positive and negative categories. 
- The `AFINN` lexicon assigns words with a score that runs between -5 and 5, with negative scores indicating negative sentiment and positive scores indicating positive sentiment.

---

# Different sources of sentiment
```{r get-sentiment-afinn}
get_sentiments("afinn")
```

---
# Sentiment analysis

- Once you have a bag of words, you need to join the sentiments dictionary to the words data. 
- Particularly the lexicon `nrc` has multiple tags per word, so you may need to use an "inner_join". 
- `inner_join()` returns all rows from x where there are matching values in y, and all columns from x and y. 
- If there are multiple matches between x and y, all combination of the matches are returned.

# Exploring sentiment in Jane Austen

`janeaustenr` package contains the full texts, ready for analysis for for Jane Austen's 6 completed novels: 

1. "Sense and Sensibility"
2. "Pride and Prejudice"
3. "Mansfield Park"
4. "Emma"
5. "Northanger Abbey"
6. "Persuasion"

  filter(sentiment == "joy")

tidy_books %>%
  filter(book == "Emma") %>%

  count(word, sort = TRUE)
```

---
# Count joyful words in "Emma"

"Good" is the most common joyful word, followed by "young", "friend", "hope". 

All make sense until you see "found". 

Is "found" a joyful word?

# Example: Simpsons

Data from the popular animated TV series, The Simpsons, has been made available on [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/wcukierski/the-simpsons-by-the-data/data). 

- `simpsons_script_lines.csv`: Contains the text spoken during each episode (including details about which character said it and where)

# (if time) Example: AFL Finals tweets

The `rtweet` package allows you to pull tweets from the archive. It gives only the last 6-9 days worth of data. You need to have a twitter account, and you need to create an app (its really basic) in order to pull twitter data. The instructions that come from this package (https://rtweet.info) are pretty simple to follow.

---
# (if time) Example: AFL Finals tweets


Given that it is AFL final week, I thought it might be interesting to look at tweets that use the hashtag "#AFLFinals". Once you have a developer account, this is as simple as 

```
afl <- search_tweets(
  "#AFLFinals", n = 20000, include_rts = FALSE
)
```

---
# (if time) Example: AFL Finals tweets

Here is the data collected in the previous year's AFL finals.

```{r load-afl}
afl <- read_rds("data/afl_twitter_past.rds")
afl
```

---
# Your turn

- When was the final played last year?
- What is the range of dates of this data?
- Who is the most frequent tweeter using this hashtag?
- Are there some days that have more tweets than others?
- Are there some hours of the day that are more common tweet times?
]

---
# Your Turn: Sentiment analysis

We need to break text of each tweet into words, tag words with sentiments, and make a cumulative score for each tweet.

- Which tweeter is the most positive? negative?
- Is there a day that spirits were higher in the tweets? Or when tweets were more negative?
- Does the tweeter `aflratings` have a trend in positivity or negativity?

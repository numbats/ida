This is the course website. This page shows information about the consultation times, MoVE, and Schedule and lecture notes.

The "Assessments" tab above provides information about all assessment for ETC1010.

## Expectations 

- Unless your question is a personal issue or an administrative matter, please do not send us direct email. The [ED site](https://edstem.org/) is appropriate for questions related to the course material.
- For personal or administrative issues, the email contact is: ETC1010.Clayton-x@monash.edu
- ED is used for asking for help, reading and lab exercise quizzes and assignment turn in. Only your name and email is stored in this system.
- **If you register after the start of the semester** or if you
  miss a lecture/lab, it is your responsibility to catch up with
  missed material, learn about due dates for material to be turned in,
  and getting assigned to a group for team work.

## Consultation times

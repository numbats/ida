## Assignments

Information to complete the assignments is below:

- Unzip the file and double click on the rstudio project, "assignment-1-2020-s1.Rproj" This contains the data and Rmd file
- **Note that the assignment is also on rstudio.cloud as well, named after the assessment task. So Assignment 1 will be named, "Assignment 1".**


```{r assignments}
assignment_df <- data.frame(
  Assignment = 1,
  `Due Date` = "2020/04/01 at 5pm",
  Instructions = "link"
)

assignment_df %>% 
kable(escape = FALSE, 
      align = c("l", "c", "l")) %>% 
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped",
                fixed_thead = T) %>% 
  column_spec(1, width = "0.5cm") %>% 
  column_spec(2, width = "1cm") %>% 
  column_spec(3, width = "3cm") 
```

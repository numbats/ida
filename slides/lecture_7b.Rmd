# What is correlation?

- Linear association between two variables can be described by correlation
- Ranges from -1 to +1

---
# Strong Positive correlation

As one variable increases, so does another

```{r plot-strong-pos-corr, echo = FALSE}
gg_xy_cor(df_cor, 1)
```

---
# Strong Positive correlation

As one variable increases, so does another variable

```{r plot-pos-corr, echo = FALSE}
gg_xy_cor(df_cor, 0.75)
```

---
# Zero correlation: neither variables are related

```{r plot-meh-corr, echo = FALSE}
gg_xy_cor(df_cor, 0)
```

---
# Strong negative correlation

As one variable increases, another decreases

```{r plot-neg-corr, echo = FALSE}
gg_xy_cor(df_cor, -0.5)
```

---
# STRONG negative correlation

As one variable increases, another decreases

```{r plot-strong-neg-corr, echo = FALSE}

# definition of correlation

For two variables $X, Y$, correlation is:

$$r=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i-\bar{x})(y_i-\bar{y})}{\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i-\bar{x})^2}\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(y_i-\bar{y})^2}} = \frac{cov(X,Y)}{s_xs_y}$$

# Remember! Correlation does not equal causation

---
# What is $R^2$?

- (model variance)/(total variance), the amount of variance in response explained by the model. 
- Always ranges between 0 and 1, with 1 indicating a perfect fit. 
- Adding more variables to the model will always increase $R^2$, so what is important is how big an increase is gained. - Adjusted $R^2$ reduces this for every additional variable added.

# AIC, BIC, Deviance

- **AIC**, **BIC**, and **Deviance** are evidence to make a decision
- Deviance is the residual variation, how much variation in response that IS NOT explained by the model. The close to 0 the better, but it is not on a standard scale. In comparing two models if one has substantially lower deviance, then it is a better model.
- Similarly BIC (Bayes Information Criterion) indicates how well the model fits, best used to compare two models. Lower is better.

# Gapminder

- Hans Rosling was a Swedish doctor, academic and statistician, Professor of International Health at Karolinska Institute. Sadley he passed away in 2017. 
- He developed a keen interest in health and wealth across the globe, and the relationship with other factors like agriculture, education, energy. 
- You can play with the gapminder data using animations at https://www.gapminder.org/tools/.

# "Change in life expectancy in countries over time?"

```{r gg-gapminder-line, fig.height = 4, echo = FALSE}
gapminder %>% 
  ggplot(aes(year, lifeExp, group = country)) +
    geom_line(alpha = 1/3)

```

???

- Plot life expectancy by year, for each country.
- What do you learn?

---
# "Change in life expectancy in countries over time?"

- There generally appears to be an increase in life expectancy
- A number of countries have big dips from the 70s through 90s
- a cluster of countries starts off with low life expectancy but ends up close to the highest by the end of the period.

Australia was already had one of the top life expectancies in the 1950s.

# Center year

- Let us treat 1950 is the first year
- so for model fitting we are going to shift year to begin in 1950
- This improved interpretability.

```{r center-eyar}

# Plot standardised residuals against year

             colour = "white", 
             size = 2) +
  geom_line() 

```

---
# Making inferences from this

- Life expectancy has increased 2.3 years every decade, on average. 
- There was a slow period from 1960 through to 1972, probably related to mortality during the Vietnam war.

# Can we fit for New Zealand?

# Is there a better way?

Like, what if we wanted to fit a model for ALL countries?

--

Let's tinker with the data.

---
# `nest()` country level data (one row = one country)

```{r nest}
by_country <- gap %>% 
  select(country, year1950, lifeExp, continent) %>%
  group_by(country, continent) %>% 
  nest()

by_country
```

---
# What is in `data`?

```{r show-nest}
by_country$data[[1]]
```

--

# It's a list!

---
# fit a linear model to each one?

```{r fit-many-model}
lm_afganistan <- lm(lifeExp ~ year1950, data = by_country$data[[1]])
lm_albania <- lm(lifeExp ~ year1950, data = by_country$data[[2]])
lm_algeria <- lm(lifeExp ~ year1950, data = by_country$data[[3]])

- Generally the relationship is negative: this means that if a country started with a high intercept tends to have lower rate of increase.
- There is a difference across the continents: Countries in Europe and Oceania tended to start with higher life expectancy and increased; countries in Asia and America tended to start lower but have high rates of improvement; Africa tends to start lower and have a huge range in rate of change.
- Three countries had negative growth in life expectancy: Rwand, Zimbabwe, Zambia

Open the app available at [https://ebsmonash.shinyapps.io/SSregression/](https://ebsmonash.shinyapps.io/SSregression/). (The original version was obtained from [https://github.com/paternogbc/SSregression](https://github.com/paternogbc/SSregression), developed by Gustavo Brant Paterno, a PhD student from Brazil.)

The app simulates some data using different slopes and error variance. It allows you to see how characteristics of the data affect model summaries. Time to play!

1. Vary the slope from high positive to zero. What happens to the error variance? The total variance and the regression variance (due to model)? Does the proportion of variation of each component change? How? Is this the same if you vary from large negative slope to zero?
2. Holding the slope fixed at 1, increase the standard deviation of the error model. What happens to components of variation?
3. As the slope changes, what happens to the intercept?
4. Why isn't the estimated slope the same as what is set by the slider?

```{r variance, echo=FALSE, eval = FALSE}
quiz(
  question("Which following is the `total variation`?",
    answer("The sum of squared difference between observed response and fitted values."),
    answer("The sum of squared difference between observed response and average response.", correct = TRUE),
    answer("The sum of squared difference between fitted response and average response.")),
  
  question("Which following is the `model variation`?",
    answer("The sum of squared difference between observed response and fitted values."),
    answer("The sum of squared difference between observed response and average response."),
    answer("The sum of squared difference between fitted response and average response.", correct = TRUE)), 
  
  question("Which following is the `residual variance`?",
    answer("The sum of squared difference between observed response and fitted values.", correct = TRUE),
    answer("The sum of squared difference between observed response and average response."),
    answer("The sum of squared difference between fitted response and average response."))
)

# The challenges of working with dates and times

- Conventional order of day, month, year is different across location
  - Australia: DD-MM-YYYY
  - America: MM-DD-YYYY
  - [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601): YYYY-MM-DD

# The challenges of working with dates and times

- Number of units change:
    - Years do not have the same number of days (leap years)
    - Months have differing numbers of days. (January vs February vs September)
    - Not every minute has 60 seconds (leap seconds!)
- Times are local, for us. Where are you?
- Timezones!!!


---
# The challenges of working with dates and times

- Representing time relative to it's type:
   - What day of the week is it? 
   - Day of the month? 
   - Week in the year?
- Years start on different days (Monday, Sunday, ...)

---
# The challenges of working with dates and times

- Representing time relative to it's type:
  - Months could be numbers or names. (1st month, January)
  - Days could be numbers of names. (1st day....Sunday? Monday?)
  - Days and Months have abbreviations. (Mon, Tue, Jan, Feb)

---
# The challenges of working with dates and times

- Time can be relative: 
  - How many days until we go on holidays?
  - How many working days?

# Parsing dates & time zones using `ymd()`

# `ymd()` can take a character input

```{r show-ymd}

```{r moar-ymd}
ymd("2019-08-10")

# yeah, wow, I was actually surprised this worked

# Change the letters, change the output

```{r show-mdy}

If you add a time zone, what changes?

# Extracting temporal elements

- Very often we want to know what day of the week it is
- Trends and patterns in data can be quite different depending on the type of day:
  - week day vs. weekend
  - weekday vs. holiday
  - regular saturday night vs. new years eve 

---
# Many ways of saying similar things

- Many ways to specify day of the week:
  - A number. Does 1 mean... Sunday, Monday or even Saturday???
  - Or text or or abbreviated text. (Mon vs. Monday)

---
# Many ways of saying similar things
  
- Talking with people we generally use day name:
  - Today is Friday, tomorrow is Saturday vs Today is 5 and tomorrow is 6.
- But, doing data analysis on days might be useful to have it represented as a number:
  - e.g., Saturday - Thursday is 2 days (6 - 4)

---
# The Many ways to say Monday (Pt 1)

```{r wday-and-options}
wday("2019-08-12")
wday("2019-08-12", label = TRUE)
```

---
# The Many ways to say Monday (Pt 2)

```{r}
wday("2019-08-12", label = TRUE, abbr = FALSE)
wday("2019-08-12", label = TRUE, week_start = 1)
```


---
# Similarly, we can extract what month the day is in.

```{r month-label-abbr}
month("2019-08-10")
month("2019-08-10", label = TRUE)
month("2019-08-10", label = TRUE, abbr = FALSE)
```

---
# Fiscally, it is useful to know what quarter the day is in.

```{r quarter-semester}
quarter("2019-08-10")
semester("2019-08-10")
```

---
# Similarly, we can select days within a year. 

```{r yday}
yday("2019-08-10")
```

---
# Our Turn:

- Open rstudio.cloud and check out Lecture 3B and follow along.

---
## Example: pedestrian sensor

```{r show-pedestrian-sensor, echo = FALSE, out.width = "100%"}
include_graphics("images/sensors.png")
```

---
# [Melbourne pedestrian sensor portal](http://www.pedestrian.melbourne.vic.gov.au/):

- Contains hourly counts of people walking around the city. 
- Extract records for 2018 for the sensor at Melbourne Central
- Use lubridate to extract different temporal components, so we can study the pedestrian patterns at this location. 

---

```{r rwalkr-load, eval = FALSE}
library(rwalkr)
walk_all <- melb_walk_fast(year = 2018)
library(dplyr)

walk <- walk_all %>% filter(Sensor == "Melbourne Central")

write_csv(walk, path = "data/walk_2018.csv")
```


```{r read-walk}
walk <- readr::read_csv("data/walk_2018.csv")
walk
```

---
# Let's think about the data structure.

.left-code[

- The basic time unit is hour of the day. 
- Date can be decomposed into 
    - month
    - week day vs weekend
    - week of the year
    - day of the month
    - holiday or work day
    
]

.right-plot[

![](images/Time.png)
]


---
# What format is walk in?

```{r print-walk}
walk
```

---
# Create variables with these different temporal components. 

```{r walk-tidy}
walk_tidy <- walk %>%
  mutate(month = month(Date,  label = TRUE, abbr = TRUE), 
         wday = wday(Date, label = TRUE, abbr = TRUE, week_start = 1))
walk_tidy
```

---
# Pedestrian count per month

.left-code[
```{r gg-walk-month-count, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(walk_tidy,
       aes(x = month, 
           y = Count)) + 
  geom_col()
```  
]

.right-plot[

```{r gg-walk-month-count-out, ref.label = 'gg-walk-month-count', echo = FALSE, out.width = "100%"}

```
]

???

- January has a very low count relative to the other months. Something can't be right with this number, because it is much lower than expected.
- The remaining months have roughly the same counts.

---
# Pedestrian count per weekday

.left-code[
```{r gg-wday-count, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(walk_tidy,
       aes(x = wday,
           y = Count)) + 
  geom_col()
```  
]

.right-plot[
```{r gg-wday-count-out, ref.label = 'gg-wday-count', echo = FALSE, out.width = "100%"}

```
]

???

How would you describe the pattern?

- Friday and Saturday tend to have a few more people walking around than other days.

---
# What might be wrong with these interpretations?

- There might be a different number of days of the week over the year.
- This means that simply summing the counts might lead to a misinterpretation of pedestrian patterns. 
- Similarly, months have different numbers of days.

---
# Your Turn: Brainstorm in a group to answer these questions:

1. Are pedestrian counts different depending on the month?
2. Are pedestrian counts different depending on the day of the week?

---
# What are the number of pedestrians per day?

```{r walk-day}
walk_day <- walk_tidy %>% 
  group_by(Date) %>%
  summarise(day_count = sum(Count, na.rm = TRUE))

walk_day
```

---
# What are the mean number of people per weekday?

```{r walk-day-summarise}
walk_week_day <- walk_day %>%
  mutate(wday = wday(Date, label = TRUE, abbr = TRUE, week_start = 1)) %>% 
  group_by(wday) %>%
  summarise(m = mean(day_count, na.rm = TRUE),
            s = sd(day_count, na.rm = TRUE))

walk_week_day
```

---
```{r gg-walk-day, fig.width = 8, fig.height = 3}
ggplot(walk_week_day) + 
  geom_errorbar(aes(x = wday, ymin = m - s, ymax = m + s)) +
  ylim(c(0, 45000)) +
  labs(x = "Day of week", 
       y = "Average number of predestrians")
```

# Why text analysis?

- To use the realtors text description to improve the Melbourne housing price model
- Determine the extent of public discontent with train stoppages in Melbourne
- The differences between Darwin's first edition of the Origin of the Species and the 6th edition
- Does the sentiment of posts on Newcastle Jets public facebook page reflect their win/los record?

---
# Typical Process

1. Read in text
2. Pre-processing: remove punctuation signs, remove numbers, stop words, stem words
3. Tokenise: words, sentences, ngrams, chapters
4. Summarise
5. model

---
# Packages

In addition to `tidyverse` we will be using three other packages today

```{r list-pkgs}
library(tidytext)
library(genius)
library(gutenbergr)
```

---
# Tidytext

- Using tidy data principles can make many text mining tasks easier, more effective, and consistent with tools already in wide use.
- Learn more at https://www.tidytextmining.com/, by Julia Silge and David Robinson.

---
# What is tidy text?

```{r show-text}
text <- c("This will be an uncertain time for us my love",
          "I can hear the echo of your voice in my head",
          "Singing my love",
          "I can see your face there in my hands my love",
          "I have been blessed by your grace and care my love",
          "Singing my love")

text
```

---
# What is tidy text?

```{r tidy-text-tile}
text_df <- tibble(line = seq_along(text), text = text)

text_df
```

---
# What is tidy text?

```{r unnest-tokens}
text_df %>%
  unnest_tokens(
    output = word,
    input = text,
    token = "words" # default option
  ) 
```

---
# What is unnesting?

```{r unnest-tokens-chars}
text_df %>%
  unnest_tokens(
    output = word,
    input = text,
    token = "characters"
  )
```

---
# What is unnesting - ngrams length 2

```{r unnest-tokens-ngram-2}
text_df %>%
  unnest_tokens(
    output = word,
    input = text,
    token = "ngrams",
    n = 2
  )
```

---
# What is unnesting - ngrams length 3

```{r unnest-tokens-ngram-3}
text_df %>%
  unnest_tokens(
    output = word,
    input = text,
    token = "ngrams",
    n = 3

# Analyzing lyrics of one artist

---
# Let's get more data

We'll use the `genius` package to get song lyric data from [Genius](https://genius.com/).

- `genius_album()` allows you to download the lyrics for an entire album in a 
tidy format. 

---
# getting more data

- Input: Two arguments: `artists` and `album`. If it gives you issues check that you have the album name and
artists as specified on [Genius](https://genius.com/).

- Output: A tidy data frame with three columns:
    - `title`: track name
    - `track_n`: track number
    - `text`: lyrics

# Stop words

- In computing, stop words are words which are filtered out before or after processing of natural language data (text).
- They usually refer to the most common words in a language, but there is not a single list of stop words used by all natural language processing tools.

# Sentiment analysis

- One way to analyze the sentiment of a text is to consider the text as a combination of its individual words 

- and the sentiment content of the whole text as the sum of the sentiment content of the individual words

# Your Turn:

- go to rstudio.cloud and repeat the analyses done in the lecture for your own artists.

# Part Two: Tidy Text analysis on Books

---
# Getting some books to study

The [Gutenberg project](http://www.gutenberg.org/wiki/Main_Page) provides the text of over 57000 books free online. 

Let's explore The Origin of the Species by Charles Darwin using the `gutenbergr` R package.

--

We need to know the `id` of the book, which means looking this up online anyway. 
- The first edition is `1228`
- The sixth edition is `2009`

---
# Packages used

- We need the `tm` package to remove numbers from the page, and `gutenbergr` to access the books.

```{r load-extra-pkgs}
# The tm package is needed because the book has numbers
# in the text, that need to be removed, and the
# install.packages("tm")
library(tm)
library(gutenbergr)
```

---
# Download darwin

```{r download-darwin}

# remove the numbers from the text
darwin1$text <- removeNumbers(darwin1$text)

# Your turn:

- Does it look like the 6th edition was an expanded version of the first?
- What word is most frequent in both editions?
- Find some words that are not in the first edition but appear in the 6th.
- Find some words that are used the first edition but not in the 6th.
- Using a linear regression model find the top few words that appear more often than expected, based on the frequency in the first edition. Find the top few words that appear less often than expected. 

---
# Book comparison

Idea: Find the important words for the content of each document by decreasing the weight of commonly used words and increasing the weight for words that are not used very much in a collection or corpus of documents.

---
# Term frequency, inverse document frequency (`tf_idf`).

Helps measure word importance of a document in a collection of documents.

E.g, A novel in a collection of novels, a website in a collection of websites.

$$tf_{word} = \frac{Number~of~times~word~t~appears~in~a~document}{Total~number~of~words~in~the~document}$$

$$idf_{word} = log \frac{number~of~documents}{number~of~documents~word~appears~in}$$

$$tf_idf = tf\times idf$$

# What do we learn?

- Prof title is used more often in the 6th edition
- There is a tendency for latin names 
- Mistletoe was mispelled in the 1st edition

# Lab exercise 


Text Mining with R has an example comparing historical physics textbooks:  *Discourse on Floating Bodies* by Galileo Galilei, *Treatise on Light* by Christiaan Huygens, *Experiments with Alternate Currents of High Potential and High Frequency* by Nikola Tesla, and *Relativity: The Special and General Theory* by Albert Einstein. All are available on the Gutenberg project. 

Work your way through the [comparison of physics books](https://www.tidytextmining.com/tfidf.html#a-corpus-of-physics-texts). It is section 3.4.

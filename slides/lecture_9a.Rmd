# Network analysis

# A description of phone calls

- Johnny --> Liz
- Liz --> Anna

# As a graph

```{r make-call-graph, echo = FALSE}
simple <- make_graph('bull')
V(simple)$name <- c('Johnny', 'Dan', 'Liz', 'Lucy', 'Anna')

example <- as_tbl_graph(simple)
ggraph(example, layout = 'graphopt') +

# And as an association matrix

[DEMO]

---
# Nodes and edges?

Netword data can be thought of as two related tables, **nodes** and **edges**:

- **nodes** are connection points
- **edges** are the connections between points

---
# Example: Mad Men. (Nodes = characters from the series)

```{r mm-show-nodes, echo=FALSE}
library(geomnet)
data(madmen)
as_tibble(madmen$vertices)
```

---
# Example: Mad Men. (Edges = how they are associated)

```{r echo=FALSE}
as_tibble(madmen$edges)
```

---
# Why care about these relationships?

- **Telephone exchanges**: Nodes are the phone numbers. Edges would indicate a call was made betwen two numbers.
- **Book or movie plots**: Nodes are the characters. Edges would indicate whether they appear together in a scene, or chapter. If they speak to each other, various ways we might measure the association.
- **Social media**: nodes would be the people who post on facebook, including comments. Edges would measure who  comments on who's posts.

---
# Drawing these relationships out:

One way to describe these relationships is to provide association matrix between many objects. 

```{r draw-association, echo = FALSE, out.width = "80%"}
include_graphics("images/network_data.png")
```

# Example: Madmen

```{r show-madmen-logo, echo = FALSE}
include_graphics("images/Mad-men-title-card.jpg")
```

---
# Generate a network view

- Create a layout (in 2D) which places nodes which are most related close,
- Plot the nodes as points, connect the appropriate lines
- Overlaying other aspects, e.g. gender

---
# introducing `tidygraph` and `ggraph`

.pull-left[
```{r make-madmen-graph}
library(tidygraph)
library(ggraph)

madmen_graph <-  tbl_graph(
  nodes = madmen$vertices,
  edges = madmen$edges,
  directed = TRUE
  )
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r print-madmen, echo = FALSE}
madmen_graph
```
]

---
# plotting using ggraph

```{r ggraph-madmen}
gg_madmen <- ggraph(madmen_graph, layout = "kk") + 
  geom_edge_link() + 
  geom_node_label(aes(colour = Gender,
                      label = label))

```

---
# plotting using ggraph

```{r print-ggraph-madmen, fig.width = 9, fig.height = 5}
gg_madmen
```

---
# Which actor was most connected?

```{r most-connected}
madmen_graph %>%
  activate(nodes) %>% 
  mutate(count = centrality_degree()) %>%
  arrange(-count) %>%
  as_tibble()
```

---
# `activate()` what now?

.pull-left[
```{r show-madmen-graph}
madmen_graph
```
]

.pull-right[
- need to tell dplyr if you are working on `nodes` or `edges`. 
- `activate` means we don't need a `mutate_nodes` or `mutate_edges` commands
]

---
# `centrality` what now?

.pull-left[
```{r}
madmen_graph %>%
  activate(nodes) %>% 
  mutate(count = centrality_degree()) %>% #<<
  arrange(-count) %>%
  as_tibble()
```
]

.pull-right[
- How central is a node or edge in a graph?
- definition is inherently vague
- there are many different centrality scores that exist
- `centrality_degree()` says: "What is the number of adjacent edges?"
]

---
# What do we learn?

- Joan Holloway had a lot of affairs, all with loyal partners except for his wife Betty, who had two affairs herself
- Followed by Woman at Clios party

# Example: American college football

Early American football outfits were like Australian AFL today!

# Example: American college football


Fall 2000 Season of [Division I college football](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_Division_I). 
- Nodes are the teams, edges are the matches. 
- Teams are broken into "conferences" which are the primary competition, but they can play outside this group.

```{r  make-football-graph, echo=FALSE}
foot_graph <- as_tbl_graph(football) %>%
  mutate(schools = if_else(value == "Independents", 
                           true = label, 
                           false = NA_character_)) %>%
  rename(conference = value,
         uni = label)
```

---
# Example: American college football

```{r print-football}
foot_graph
```


---

```{r plot-foot-graph}
set.seed(2019-09-25-1117)
gg_foot_graph <-
ggraph(foot_graph, layout = "fr") + 
  geom_edge_link(alpha = 0.2) + 
  geom_node_point(size = 7,
                  alpha = 0.9,
                  aes(colour = conference)) +
  scale_colour_brewer(palette = "Paired") + 
  theme(legend.position = "bottom") 
```

---

```{r print-gg-foot-graph, echo = FALSE, fig.width = 10, fig.height = 8, out.width = "80%"}
gg_foot_graph
```

---
# What do we learn?

- Remember layout is done to place nodes that are more similar close together in the display. 
- The colours indicate conference the team belongs too. For the most part, conferences are clustered, more similar to each other than other conferences. 
- There are some clusters of conference groups, eg Mid-American, Big East, and Atlantic Coast
- The Independents are independent
- Some teams play far afield from their conference.

# Example: Harry Potter characters

There is a connection between two students if one provides emotional support to the other at some point in the book. 
- Code to pull the data together is provided by Sam Tyner [here](https://github.com/sctyner/geomnet/blob/master/README.Rmd#harry-potter-peer-support-network).

```{r read-hp, echo=FALSE}
hp_chars <- read_csv("data/hp_chars.csv")
hp_edges <- read_csv("data/hp_edges.csv") 

hp <- tbl_graph(nodes = hp_chars,
                edges = hp_edges)
```

---
# Harry potter data as nodes and edges

```{r print-hp}
hp
```

---
# Let's plot the characters

```{r echo=TRUE}
ggraph_hp <- 
ggraph(hp,
       layout = "fr") + 
  geom_edge_link(alpha = 0.2) + 
  geom_node_point(aes(colour = house,
                      shape = gender)) + 
  # geom_node_text(aes(label = name)) +
  facet_edges(~book,
              ncol = 2) +
  scale_colour_manual(values = c("#941B08","#F1F31C", 
                                 "#071A80", "#154C07"))

# Your turn: rstudio exercise

.pull-left[
- Read in last semesters class data, which contains `s1_name` and `s2_name` are the first names of class members, and tutors, with the latter being the "go-to" person for the former. 
- Write the code to produce a class network that looks something like below

<!--
## Simpsons

Your turn to make a network diagram for the Simpsons. The measure of association will be "that the two characters had lines in the same episode together".

- How many characters appeared only in one episode? (You will want to drop these)
- Write code to search if a character has a line in an episode
- Compile a dataset of episode (rows) and character (columns) which is a binary matrix where 1 indicates the character had a line in the episode, and 0 is otherwise
- Gather the matrix into long form, with these columns: `episode`, `character`, `had a line` (0,1)
- Filter the rows with `had a line` equal to 1. 
- Count the number of times the pair of characters appeared. This now forms your edge set, with an additional column of the strength of the relationship
- Make your network display

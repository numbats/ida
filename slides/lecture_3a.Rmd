???

- First argument provided is the name of the data, `tb_au`
- Variable mapping: year is mapped to x, count is mapped to y, gender is mapped to colour, and age is used to subset the data and make separate plots
- The column geom is used, `geom_col`
- We are mostly interested in proportions between gender, over years, separately by age. The `position = "fill"` option in `geom_bar` sets the heights of the bars to be all at 100%. It ignores counts, and emphasizes the proportion of males and females.

# The "100% charts"

```{r gg-show-100pct, echo=TRUE, fig.width=8, fig.height=2}
ggplot(tb_au, aes(x = year, y = count, fill = gender)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "fill") +
  facet_grid(~ age) +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette="Dark2")
```

What do we learn

???

100% charts, is what excel names these beasts. What do we learn?

---
class: transition left
# What do we learn?

- Focus is on **proportion** in each category. 
- Across (almost) all ages, and years, the proportion of males having TB is higher than females
- These proportions tend to be higher in the older age groups, for all years.

---
# Code structure of ggplot

- `ggplot()` is the main function
- Plots are constructed in layers
- Structure of code for plots can often be summarised as

```r
ggplot(data = [dataset], 
       mapping = aes(x = [x-variable], 
                     y = [y-variable])) +
   geom_xxx() +
   other options
```

---
# How to use ggplot

- To use ggplot2 functions, first load tidyverse

```{r example-load}
library(tidyverse)
```

- For help with the ggplot2, see [ggplot2.tidyverse.org](http://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/)

# Let's look at some more options to emphasise different features

---
.left-code[
```{r first-gg-9, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(tb_au,
       aes(x = year, 
           y = count,
           fill = gender))  + 
  geom_col(position = "fill") +
  scale_fill_brewer( 
    palette = "Dark2"
    ) +
  facet_wrap(~ age) #<<
```

]

.right-plot[
```{r first-gg-9-out, ref.label = 'first-gg-9', echo = FALSE, out.width = "100%"}

```

]

---
# Emphasizing different features with ggplot2

```{r first-gg-10, fig.height = 2, fig.width = 8, out.width = "100%"}
ggplot(tb_au, 
       aes(x = year, 
           y = count, 
           fill = gender))  + 
  geom_col(position = "fill") +
  scale_fill_brewer( palette = "Dark2") +
  facet_grid(~ age) #<<
```

---
# Emphasise ... ?

```{r first-gg-11, fig.height = 2, fig.width = 8, out.width = "100%"}
ggplot(tb_au, 
       aes(x = year, 
           y = count, 
           fill = gender))  + 
  geom_col() + #<<
  scale_fill_brewer( palette = "Dark2") +
  facet_grid(~ age)
```

---
# What do we learn?

- `, position = "fill"` was removed
- Focus is on **counts** in each category. 
- Different across ages, and years, counts tend to be lower in middle age (45-64)
- 1999 saw a bit of an outbreak, in most age groups, with numbers doubling or tripling other years.
- Incidence has been increasing among younger age groups in recent years.

---
# Emphasise ... ?

```{r gg-side-by-side,  fig.height = 2, fig.width = 8, out.width = "100%"}
ggplot(tb_au, 
       aes(x = year, 
           y = count, 
           fill = gender)) +
  geom_col(position = "dodge") + #<<
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Dark2") +
  facet_grid(~ age)
```  

---
# What do we learn?

- `, position="dodge"` is used in `geom_col`
- Focus is on **counts by gender**, predominantly male incidence.
- Incidence among males relative to females is from middle age on. 
- There is similar incidence between males and females in younger age groups.

---
# Separate bar charts

```{r gg-separate, echo=TRUE, fig.width=8, fig.height=3}
ggplot(tb_au, 
       aes(x = year, y = count, fill = gender)) +
  geom_col() +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Dark2") +
  facet_grid(gender ~ age) #<<
```

---
class: transition
# What do we learn?

- `facet_grid(gender ~ age) +` faceted by gender as well as age
- note `facet_grid` vs `facet_wrap`
- Easier to focus separately on males and females.
- 1999 outbreak mostly affected males.
- Growing incidence in the 25-34 age group is still affecting females but seems to be have stablised for males.

---
# ~~Pie charts?~~ Rose Charts

```{r gg-rose, echo=TRUE, fig.width=8, fig.height=3}
ggplot(tb_au, 
       aes(x = year, y = count, fill = gender)) +
  geom_col() +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette="Dark2") + 
  facet_grid(gender ~ age) +
  coord_polar() + #<<
  theme(axis.text = element_blank())
```

---
# What do we learn?

- Bar charts in polar coordinates produce rose charts. 
- `coord_polar() +` plot is made in polar coordinates, rather than the default Cartesian coordinates
- Emphasizes the middle years as low incidence. 

---
# Rainbow charts?

```{r gg-rainbow, echo=TRUE, out.width = "100%"}
ggplot(tb_au, aes(x = 1, 
                  y = count, 
                  fill = factor(year))) + #<<
  geom_col(position = "fill") +
  facet_grid(gender ~ age) 
```

---
# What do we see in the code??

- A single stacked bar, in each facet. 
- Year is mapped to colour. 
- Notice how the mappings are different. A single number is mapped to x, that makes a single stacked bar chart.
- year is now mapped to colour (that's what gives us the rainbow charts!)

---
class: transition
# What do we learn?

- Pretty chart but not easy to interpret. 

---
# (Actual) Pie charts

```{r gg-pie2, echo=TRUE, fig.width=8, fig.height=3}
ggplot(tb_au, aes(x = 1, y = count, fill = factor(year))) +
  geom_col(position = "fill") +
  facet_grid(gender ~ age) + #<<
  coord_polar(theta = "y") + #<<
  theme(axis.text = element_blank())
```

---
# What is different in the code?

- `coord_polar(theta="y")`  is using the y variable to do the angles for the polar coordinates to give a pie chart.

---
class: transition
# What do we learn?

- Pretty chart but not easy to interpret, or make comparisons across age groups. 

---

## Why?

[The various looks of David Bowie](https://www.wired.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/DB-Transformation-Colour.gif)

.pull-left[
- Using named plots, eg pie chart, bar chart, scatterplot, is like seeing animals in the zoo. 
- The grammar of graphics allows you to define the mapping between variables in the data, with elements of the plot. 
- It allows us to see and understand how plots are similar or different. 
- And you can see how variations in the definition create variations in the plot.

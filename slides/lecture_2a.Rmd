# Your Turn: Making the groups

We are going to set up the groups for doing assignment work.

1. Find your name from the list at [this link]()
2. Find the other people in the class with the same quote as you (feel free to wander around the class!)
3. Grab your gear and claim a table to work together at.

2. If you were a comic strip character, who would you be and why?

# Today: Outline

- An aside on learning
- Tidy Data
- Terminology of data
- Different examples of data 
- Steps in making data tidy
- Lots of examples

---

# A note on difficulty

* This is not a programming course - it is a course about **data, modelling, and computing**. 

--

- At the moment, you might be sitting there, feeling a bit confused about where we are, what are are doing, what R is, and how it even works.
- That is OK!

--

- The theory of this class will only get you so far
- The real learning happens from doing the data analysis - the **pressure of a deadline can also help.**

# Tidy Data

```{r clean-data-img, echo = FALSE, output = "75%"}
include_graphics("images/cleaning-data.jpg")
```

.blockquote[
You're ready to sit down with a newly-obtained dataset, excited about how it will open a world of insight and understanding, and then find you can't use it. You'll first have to spend a significant amount of time to restructure the data to even begin to produce a set of basic descriptive statistics or link it to other data you've been using.

# Tidy Data

```{r clean-data-img-2, echo = FALSE, output = "75%"}
include_graphics("images/cleaning-data.jpg")
```


.blockquote[
"Tidy data" is a term meant to provide a framework for producing data that conform to standards that make data easier to use. Tidy data may still require some cleaning for analysis, but the job will be much easier.

# Example: US graduate programs

- Data from a study on US grad programs. 
- Originally came in an excel file containing rankings of many different programs. 
- Contains information on four programs:
  1. Astronomy
  1. Economics
  1. Entomology, and 
  1. Psychology

# Example: US graduate programs

```{r readgrad, echo = TRUE}
library(tidyverse)

# Example: US graduate programs

Good things about the format:

```{r print-grad, echo = FALSE}
head(grad) %>% as_table()
```

--

- **Rows** contain information about the institution

--

- **Columns** contain types of information, like average number of publications, average number of citations, % completion,

# Example: US graduate programs

Easy to make summaries:

```{r grad-count, echo = TRUE}
grad %>% count(subject)

# Your Turn: Open Lecture 2A in rstudio cloud

- Notice the `data/` directory with many datasets! 
- Open `graduate-programs.Rmd`
- Answer these questions:
    - "What is the average number of graduate students per economics program?"
    - "What is the best description of the relationship between number of students and median time to degree?"
- Use the traffic light system if you need a hand.

```{r cd-graduate-programs}
countdown(minutes = 3)
```

???

- "The average number of graduate students per economics program is:"
- "about 61" (correct)
- about 39

"What is the best description of the relationship between number of students and median time to degree?"

- "as the number of students increases the median time to degree increases, weakly" (correct)
- as the number of students increases the variability in median time to degree decreases

# Terminology of data: Variable

- A quantity, quality, or property that you can measure. 
- For the grad programs, these would be all the column headers.

```{r show-grad}
grad
```

---
# Terminology of data: Observation

- A set of measurements made under similar conditions
- Contains several values, each associated with a different variable.
- For the grad programs, this is institution, and program, uniquley define the observation.

```{r show-grad-again}
grad
```


---
# Terminology of data: Value

- Is the state of a variable when you measure it. 
- The value of a variable typically changes from observation to observation.
- For the grad programs, this is the value in each cell

```{r show-grad-again-again}
grad
```


---
# Tidy tabular form

__Tabular data__ is a set of values, each associated with a variable and an observation. Tabular data is __tidy__ iff (if and only if):

* Each variable in its own column, 
* Each observation in its own row,
* Each value is placed in its own `cell`.

Messy data is messy in its own way. You can make unique solutions, but then another data set comes along, and you have to again make a unique solution.

# Data Tidying verbs

- `pivot_longer`: Specify the **names_to** (identifiers) and the **values_to** (measures) to make longer form data.
- `pivot_wider`: Variables split out in columns
- `separate`: Split one column into many

---
class: refresher
# Aside: naming things is hard

- You might have come across `pivot_` functions as `spread` or `gather`. These are still valid, but have been improved upon in the latest version of the `tidyr` package.
- You can read more about this change here:

  - [tidyverse blog post](https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2019/09/tidyr-1-0-0/)
  - [tidyr vignette](http://tidyr.tidyverse.org/articles/pivot.html)
  - [Hadley Wickham's talk]()

# one more time: `pivot_longer`

             <COLS>,
             <NAMES_TO>
             <VALUES_TO>)
```

- **Cols** to select are those that represent values, not variables.
- **names_to** is the name of the variable whose values for the column names.
- **values_to** is the name of the variable whose values are spread over the cells.

# pivot_longer: example

# Examine replicates against each other

.right-plot[
```{r shoe-replicates-out, ref.label = 'shoe-replicates', echo = FALSE, out.width = "100%"}

Roughly, replicate 4 is like replicate 1, eg if one is low, the other is low. 

That's a good thing, that the replicates are fairly similar.

Here is a little data to practice `pivot_longer`, `pivot_wider` and `separate` on.

```{r koala-bilby}

- Read over `koala-bilby.Rmd`
- pivot_longer the data into long form, naming the two new variables, `label` and `count`
- Separate the labels into two new variables, `animal`, `state`
- pivot_wider the long form data into wide form, where the columns are the states. 
- pivot_wider the long form data into wide form, where the columns are the animals.

# Today: Outline

- An aside on learning
- Tidy Data
- Terminology of data
- Different examples of data 
- Steps in making data tidy
- Lots of examples

---

# A note on difficulty

* This is not a programming course - it is a course about **data, modelling, and computing**. 

--

- At the moment, you might be sitting there, feeling a bit confused about where we are, what are are doing, what R is, and how it even works.
- That is OK!

--

- The theory of this class will only get you so far
- The real learning happens from doing the data analysis - the **pressure of a deadline can also help.**

---

# An aside on learning

- I want to take the first 15 minutes of class to discuss some ideas on learning, and how this ties into the course.
- [new slides]

- (insert these slides from the tidyverse teaching.)

# Tidy Data

```{r clean-data-img, echo = FALSE, output = "75%"}
include_graphics("images/cleaning-data.jpg")
```

.blockquote[
You're ready to sit down with a newly-obtained dataset, excited about how it will open a world of insight and understanding, and then find you can't use it. You'll first have to spend a significant amount of time to restructure the data to even begin to produce a set of basic descriptive statistics or link it to other data you've been using.

# Tidy Data

```{r clean-data-img-2, echo = FALSE, output = "75%"}
include_graphics("images/cleaning-data.jpg")
```


.blockquote[
"Tidy data" is a term meant to provide a framework for producing data that conform to standards that make data easier to use. Tidy data may still require some cleaning for analysis, but the job will be much easier.

# Example: US graduate programs

- Data from a study on US grad programs. 
- Originally came in an excel file containing rankings of many different programs. 
- Contains information on four programs:
  1. Astronomy
  1. Economics
  1. Entomology, and 
  1. Psychology

---

# Example: US graduate programs

```{r readgrad, echo = TRUE}
library(tidyverse)
grad <- read_csv(here::here("slides/data/graduate-programs.csv"))
grad
```

---
# Example: US graduate programs

What's good about the format?

--

- **Rows** contain information about the institution
- **Columns** contain types of information, like average number of publications, average number of citations, % completion, 

---

# Example: US graduate programs

Easy to make summaries:

```{r grad-count, echo = TRUE}
grad %>% count(subject)
```

---

# Example: US graduate programs

Easy to make summaries:

```{r grad-filter, echo = TRUE}
grad %>%
  filter(subject == "economics") %>%
  summarise(mean = mean(NumStud),
            s = sd(NumStud))
```

---

# Example: US graduate programs

Easy to make a plot

```{r grad-plot, echo = TRUE}
grad %>%
  filter(subject == "economics") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = NumStud, 
             y = MedianTimetoDegree)) +

# Your Turn: Go to the rstudio.cloud + open Lecture 2A.

- Notice the `data/` directory with many datasets! 
- flag a tutor with the traffic light system if you need a hand.
- Open the `graduate-programs.Rmd` file
- Can you answer these questions?
    - "What is the average number of graduate students per economics program?:"
    - "What is the best description of the relationship between number of students and median time to degree?"

```{r cd-graduate-programs}
countdown(minutes = 3)
```

???

- "The average number of graduate students per economics program is:"
- "about 61" (correct)
- about 39

"What is the best description of the relationship between number of students and median time to degree?"

- "as the number of students increases the median time to degree increases, weakly" (correct)
- as the number of students increases the variability in median time to degree decreases


---
# Terminology of data: Variable

- A quantity, quality, or property that you can measure. 
- For the grad programs, these would be all the column headers.

```{r show-grad}
grad
```

---
# Terminology of data: Observation

- A set of measurements made under similar conditions
- Contains several values, each associated with a different variable.
- For the grad programs, this is institution, and program, uniquley define the observation.

```{r show-grad-again}
grad
```


---
# Terminology of data: Value

- Is the state of a variable when you measure it. 
- The value of a variable typically changes from observation to observation.
- For the grad programs, this is the value in each cell

```{r show-grad-again-again}
grad
```


---
# Tidy tabular form

__Tabular data__ is a set of values, each associated with a variable and an observation. Tabular data is __tidy__ iff (if and only if):

* Each variable in its own column, 
* Each observation in its own row,
* Each value is placed in its own `cell`.

# Messy vs tidy

.pull-left[
Messy data is messy in its own way. You can make unique solutions, but then another data set comes along, and you have to again make a unique solution. 
]

.pull-right[
Tidy data can be though of as legos. Once you have this form, you can put it together in so many different ways, to make different analyses.

```{r img-lego, echo = FALSE, out.width = "100%"}
include_graphics("images/lego.png")
```

# Data Tidying verbs

- `pivot_longer`: Specify the **keys** (identifiers) and the **values** (measures) to make long form data. You can also think of this as longer form data.
- `pivot_wider`: Variables in columns
- `separate`: Split one column into many

---

# one more time: `pivot_longer`

```r
pivot_longer(<DATA>,
             <COLS>,
             <NAMES_TO>
             <VALUES_TO>)
```

- **Cols** to select are those that represent values, not variables.
- **names_to** is the name of the variable whose values for the column names.
- **values_to** is the name of the variable whose values are spread over the cells.

---
# pivot_longer: example

.pull-left[
```{r print-table4a}
table4a
```

]

.pull-right[

```{r pivot_longer-table4}
table4a %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = c("1999", "2000"),
               names_to = "year",
               values_to = "cases")
```

# Tidying genes data

Tell me what to put in the following?

- **cols** are the columns that represent values, not variables.
- **names_to** is the name of new variable whose values for the column names.
- **values_to** is the name of the new variable whose values are spread over the cells.


```{r print-genes}
genes
```

---
# Tidy genes data

```{r pivot_longer-genes, echo = TRUE}
genes_long <- genes %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = -id,
               names_to = "variable",
               values_to = "expr")

genes_long
```

---
# Separate columns

```{r genes-separate, echo = TRUE}
genes_long %>%
  separate(col = variable, 
           into = c("trt", "leftover"), "-")
```

---
# Separate columns

```{r genes-separate-again}
genes_long_tidy <- genes_long %>%
  separate(variable, c("trt", "leftover"), "-") %>%
  separate(leftover, c("time", "rep"), "\\.") 

genes_long_tidy

```

---
class: transition
# Now pivot_wider to examine different aspects

---
## Examine treatments against each other

```{r plot-genes}
genes_long_tidy %>%
  pivot_wider(id_cols = c(id, rep, time),
              names_from = trt, 
              values_from = expr) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=WI, y=WM, colour=id)) + geom_point()
```

Generally, some negative association within each gene, WM is low if WI is high. 

---
# Examine replicates against each other

```{r}
genes_long_tidy %>%
  pivot_wider(id_cols = c(id, trt, time),
              names_from = rep, 
              values_from = expr) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=R1, y=R4, colour=id)) + 
  geom_point() + coord_equal()
```

Roughly, replicate 4 is like replicate 1, eg if one is low, the other is low. 

That's a good thing, that the replicates are fairly similar.

# Your turn: Demonstrate with koala bilby data (write this as live code)

Here is a little data set to practice pivot_longer, pivot_wider and separate on.

```{r koala-bilby}
kb <- read_csv(here::here("slides/data/koala_bilby.csv"))
kb
```

- Read over `koala-bilby.Rmd`
- pivot_longer the data into long form, naming the two new variables, `label` and `count`
- Separate the labels into two new variables, `animal`, `state`
- pivot_wider the long form data into wide form, where the columns are the states. 
- pivot_wider the long form data into wide form, where the columns are the animals.

# Exercise 1: Rude Recliners 

- Open `rude-recliners.Rmd`
- This contains data from the article [41% Of Fliers Think You're Rude If You Recline Your Seat](http://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/airplane-etiquette-recline-seat/). 
- V1 is the response to question: "Is it rude to recline your seat on a plane?"
- V2 is the response to question: "Do you ever recline your seat when you fly?".

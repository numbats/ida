# R essentials: A short list (for now)

- Functions are (most often) verbs, followed by what they will be applied to in parentheses:

.hacker-type[
```{r eval=FALSE, echo = TRUE}
do_this(to_this)
```
]
--

- Columns (variables) in data frames are accessed with `$`:

.hacker-type[
```{r eval=FALSE, echo = TRUE}
dataframe$var_name
```
]
--

- Packages are installed with `install.packages`, and loaded with `library` , once per session:

.hacker-type[
```{r eval=FALSE, echo = TRUE}
install.packages("package_name")
library(package_name)
```
]

# So what can we do about it?

---

# Reproducibility checklist

Near-term goals:

- Are the tables and figures reproducible from the code and data?
- Does the code actually do what you think it does?
- In addition to what was done, is it clear **why** it was done? 
(e.g., how were parameter settings chosen?)

---

# Reproducibility checklist


Long-term goals:

- Can the code be used for other data?
- Can you extend the code to do other things?

---

# Literate programming is a partial solution

- Literate programming shines some light on this dark area of science. 

- An idea from [Donald Knuth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Knuth) where you combine your text with your code output to create a document. 

- A _blend_ of your literature (**text**), and your programming (**code**), to create something you can read from top to bottom. 

---

# So

--

Imagine a report:

Introduction, methods, results, discussion, and conclusion,

--

and all the bits of code that make each section. 


With rmarkdown, you can see all the pieces of your data analysis all together.

Each time you knit the analysis is ran from the beginning

---
# Markdown as a new player to legibility

--

In 2004, [John Gruber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Gruber), of [daring fireball](https://daringfireball.net/) created [markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown), a simple way to create text that rendered into a HTML webpage.

# Markdown as a new player to legibility

With very little marking up, we can create rich text, that **actually resembles** the text that we want to see.

# Rmarkdown helps address the reproducibility problem

--

* Q: How do we take `markdown` + `R code` = "literate programming environment"

* A: `Rmarkdown` 

---

# Rmarkdown...

--

Provides an environment where you can write your complete analysis, and marries your text, and code together into a rich document. 

--

You write your code as code chunks, put your text around that, and then hey presto, you have a document you can reproduce.

---
# Reminder: You've already used rmarkdown!

```{r remind-unvotes, out.width = "90%"}
include_graphics("images/unvotes-oz-usa.png")
```


---

# How will we use R Markdown?

- Every assignment + project /  is an R Markdown document
- You'll always have a template R Markdown document to start with
- The amount of scaffolding in the template will decrease over the semester
- These lecture notes are created using R Markdown (!)

---

# The anatomy of an rmarkdown document

There are three parts to an rmarkdown document.

- Metadata (YAML)
- Text (markdown formatting)
- Code (code formatting)

--

.vhuge.center[DEMO]

---
# Metadata: YAML  (YAML Ain't Markup Language) 

- The metadata of the document tells you how it is formed - what the **title** is, what **date** to put, and other control information.  

- If you're familiar with $\LaTeX$, this is similar to how you specify document type, styles, fonts, options, etc in the front matter / preamble.

---
# Metadata: YAML

- Rmarkdown documents use YAML to provide the metadata. It looks like this:

```YAML
---
title: "An example document"
author: "Nicholas Tierney"
output: html_document
---
```

It starts an ends with three dashes `---`, and has fields like the following: `title`, `author`, and `output`.

---
# Text

Is markdown, as we discussed in the earlier section,

It provides a simple way to mark up text

.pull-left[

```
1. bullet list
2. bullet list
3. bullet list
```

]

.pull-right[

1. bullet list
1. bullet list
1. bullet list

]

---
# Code

We refer to code in an rmarkdown document in two ways:

1. Code chunks, and 
2. Inline code.

---

# Code: Code chunks

`Code chunks` are marked by three backticks and curly braces with `r` inside them:

````markdown
```{r chunk-name}`r ''`
# a code chunk
```
````

---
# Code: backtick?

**A backtick** is a special character you might not have seen before, it is typically located under the tilde key (`~`). On USA / Australia keyboards, is under the escape key:


```{r show-backtick, out.width = "80%", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/ansi-keyboard.png")
```

.small[

]

---
# Code: Inline code

Sometimes you want to run the code inside a sentence. This is called running the code "inline".

--

You might want to run the code inline to name the number of variables or rows in a dataset in a sentence like:

> There are XXX observations in the airquality dataset, and XXX variables.

---

# Code: Inline code

You can call code "inline"  like so:

.hacker-type[
````markdown

There are `r "\u0060r nrow(airquality) \u0060"` observations in the airquality dataset, 
and `r "\u0060r ncol(airquality) \u0060"` variables.

````
]

Which gives you the following sentence

--

.hacker-type[
> There are `r nrow(airquality)` observations in the airquality dataset, and `r ncol(airquality)` variables.
]

---


# Code: Inline code

- If your data changes upstream

--

- You don't need to work out where you mentioned your data

--

- You just update the document. `r emo::ji("tada")`
 
---
# Your Turn: Put it together

Go to `rstudio.cloud` and 

* open the document "01-oz-atlas.Rmd"
* knit the document 
* Change the data section at the top to be from a different state instead of "New South Wales"
* knit the document again
* How do the text and figures in the document change?

```{r cdown-rmd-inline}
countdown(minutes = 5)
```

---
# Code: Chunk names

Straight after the ` ```{r ` you can use a text string to name the chunk:

````markdown
```{r read-crime-data}`r ''`
crime <- read_csv("data/crime-data.csv")
```
````

---
# Code: Chunk names

Naming code chunks has three advantages:

1. Navigate to specific chunks using the drop-down code navigator in the bottom-left of the script editor.
2. Graphics produced by chunks now have useful names.
3. You can set up networks of cached chunks to avoid re-performing expensive computations on every run.

---
# Code: Chunk names

Every chunk should ideally have a name.

Naming things is hard, but follow these rules and you'll be fine:

1. One word that describes the action (e.g., "read")
2. One word that describes the thing inside the code (e.g, "gapminder")
3. Separate words with "-" (e.g., `read-gapminder`)

---
# Code: Chunk options

You can control how the code is output by changing the code chunk options which follow the title. 

````markdown
```{r read-gapminder, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}`r ''`
gap <- read_csv("gapminder.csv")
```
````

What do you think this does?

```{r countdown-chunk}
countdown(minutes = 0, seconds = 30)
```


---
# Code: Chunk options

The code chunk options you need to know about right now are:

  * `cache`: TRUE / FALSE. Do you want to save the output of the chunk so it doesn't have to run next time?
  * `eval`: TRUE / FALSE Do you want to evaluate the code?
  * `echo`: TRUE / FALSE Do you want to print the code?
  * `include`: TRUE / FALSE Do you want to include code output in the final output document? Setting to `FALSE` means nothing is put into the output document, but the code is still run.

You can read more about the options at the official documentation: https://yihui.name/knitr/options/#code-evaluation

---
# Your turn

* go to `rstudio.cloud`, open document `01-oz-atlas.Rmd` and change the document so that the code output is hidden, but the graphics are shown. (Hint: Google "rstudio rmarkdown cheatsheet" for some tips!)
* Re-Knit the document.
* Take a look at the [R Markdown Gallery](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/gallery.html).

```{r cdown-rmd-chunk-opts}
countdown(minutes = 5)
```

---
class: transition
# End of Part 2 of Lecture 1B

---
class: transition
# Start of Part 3 of Lecture 1B

---
# Global options: Set and forget

You can set the default chunk behaviour once at the top of the `.Rmd` file using a chunk like:

```r
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  echo = FALSE,
  cache = TRUE
)
```

then you will only need to add chunk options when you have the occasional one that you'd like to behave differently.

---
# Your turn

* Go to your `01-oz-atlas.Rmd` document on `rstudio.cloud` and change the global settings at the top of the rmarkdown document to `echo = FALSE`, and `cache = TRUE`

```r
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  echo = FALSE,
  cache = TRUE
)
```

- Update the other code chunks by removing the code chunk options.


```{r countdown-cloud}
countdown(minutes = 5,
          left = 0, 
          right = 0,
          padding = "15px",
          margin = "3%",
          font_size = "4em",
          play_sound = TRUE)
```

# DEMO

The many different outputs of rmarkdown

---
# Your turn: Different types of documents 

1. Change the output of your current R Markdown file to produce a **Word document**. Now try to produce pdf - this may not work! That's OK, we do'nt need it right now.
2. Create a new document that will produce a slide show `File > New R Markdown > Presentation`
3. Create a flexdashboard document - see this option in the `File > New R Markdown > From template` list.


---
# Your Turn

- Go to rstudio.cloud to `oz-atlas-final.Rmd`
- Read through the document and add text where prompted to learn more about the Australian native platypus!

---

# Recap:

- There is a Reproducibility Crisis
- rmarkdown = YAML + text + code
- rmarkdown has many different output types
- Platypus are interesting!
- Assignment will be announced later today

---

# Learning more:

- [R Markdown cheat sheet](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/rmarkdown-2.0.pdf) and Markdown Quick Reference (Help -> Markdown Quick Reference) handy, we'll refer to it often as the course progresses

---

# Lab quiz

Take the quiz for today from ED.

```{r endslide, child="components/endslide.Rmd"}
```

- If you have a big document, build it up in pieces. You can run just one code chunk at a time, or the past several, or even one line of code. The "Run" button has a menu of options of doing the coding in pieces.
 
- The workspace of your R Markdown document is separate from the Console

- rmarkdown runs code from the start to finish in a new environment

* Reproducibility: Why we care
* Rmarkdown 
  * YAML

Should be able to answer the questions:

How should I start an rmarkdown document?
What do I put in the YAML metadata?
How do I create a code chunk?
What sort of options to I need to worry about for my code?
What is the value in a reproducible report?
What is markdown?
Can I combine my software and my writing?

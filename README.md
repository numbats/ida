## Website 

* If you open up the RStudio Project in RStudio IDE, you should see a Build tab. If you click on "Build Website", it will build and preview your website -- see files `_site.yml`, `_navbar.html`, and `index.Rmd` to configure components. Note all Rmd files in root directory will be compiled. 

## Slides

* All slide files are in the folder slides. 
* The slide folder contains the monash animnated logo and monash brand colors.
* Try knitting the document `slide/demo.Rmd`.
* Modify from `slide/demo.Rmd` to what you need.

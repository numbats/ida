# simple example of `read_html`

# Let's read it in with `read_html`

```{r read-html}
example <- read_html(here::here("data/example.html"))
example
```


- We have two parts - head and body - which makes sense based on `example.html`

# Now let's get the title

```{r read-html-title}
example %>% 
  html_nodes("title")
```

# Now let's get the paragraph text

```{r read-html-para}
example %>% 
  html_nodes("p")
```

# You can look at the `example.html` file if you want to see the data!

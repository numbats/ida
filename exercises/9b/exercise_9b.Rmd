# Quantitative association matrices

Previous association matrices were black and white: 

```{r show-network-data, out.width = "80%", echo = FALSE}
include_graphics("images/network_data.png")
```

---
# Quantitative association matrices

- You could have the association between nodes described as real numbers.

--

- E.g., these are the number of times that these people called each other in the last week:

```{r show-n-times-ppl-called, echo = FALSE}
d <- matrix(c(0, 5, 4, 1, 1, 
              5, 0, 4, 2, 1,
              4, 4, 0, 0, 0,
              1, 2, 0, 0, 6,
              1, 1, 0, 6, 0), ncol=5, byrow=T)
colnames(d) <- c("Meg", "Tay", "Yat", "Zili", "Jess")
rownames(d) <- colnames(d)
kable(d)
```

---
# Quantitative association matrices

We would need to turn this into an edge data set:

```{r show-edges, echo=FALSE}
d_edges <- d %>% as_tibble() %>%
  mutate(from = rownames(d)) %>%
  gather(to, count, -from)
d_edges
```

---
# Quantitative association matrices

- We need to decide what corresponds to a "connection".
- Let's say they need to have called each other at least 4 times, to be considered connected.


```{r decide-connections, echo = TRUE}
d_edges_filter <- d_edges %>% filter(count > 3)
```

--

```{r decide-connections-print, echo = TRUE}
d_edges_filter
```

---
# Association matrices: Make the network diagram.

.left-code[
```{r geom-net-cals, eval = FALSE}
library(geomnet)
set.seed(2020-05-09)
ggplot(data = d_edges_filter, 
       aes(
         from_id = from, 
         to_id = to)) +

    layout.alg = "kamadakawai",

# Data: Last 4 months of currency USD cross-rates in 2018
SO let's try this with cross-currency rates across the globe!

- Data extracted from http://openexchangerates.org/api/historical
- R packages `jsonlite`, processed with `tidyverse`, `lubridate`

---
# Data: Last 4 months of currency USD cross-rates in 2018

```{r show-rates, echo=FALSE, fig.width=5, fig.height=5}
rates <- read_csv(here::here("slides/data/rates_new.csv"))
rates <- rates %>% 
  distinct() %>%  
  arrange(date)
rates %>% head()
```

---
# Data: Last 4 months of currency USD cross-rates in 2018

```{r plot-rates, echo=FALSE, out.width = "100%"}
p1 <- ggplot(rates, aes(x=date, y=AUD)) + geom_line()
p2 <- ggplot(rates, aes(x=date, y=EUR)) + geom_line()
p3 <- ggplot(rates, aes(x=date, y=JPY)) + geom_line()
p4 <- rates %>% select(date, AUD, EUR, JPY) %>%
  gather(curr, value, -date) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=date, y=value, colour=curr, group=curr)) + 
    geom_line() + theme(legend.position="none") +
  scale_colour_brewer(palette="Dark2")
grid.arrange(p1, p2, p3, p4, ncol=2)
```

---
# Your turn: Rstudio

Make some plots (or google) to answer these questions

- Is the NZD more similar to AUD, EUR, or JPY? (What currency is NZD?)
- Is SGD more similar to AUD, EUR, or JPY? (What currency is SGD?)
- How many currencies are there in the British Isles? 

---

```{r show-many-currencies, out.width = "100%", echo = FALSE}
p1 <- ggplot(rates, aes(x=date, y=AUD)) + geom_line()
p2 <- ggplot(rates, aes(x=date, y=EUR)) + geom_line()
p3 <- ggplot(rates, aes(x=date, y=JPY)) + geom_line()
p4 <- ggplot(rates, aes(x=date, y=SGD)) + geom_line()
grid.arrange(p1, p2, p3, p4, ncol=2)
```

# Pre-processing: Keep currencies that change

- Some currencies don't change very much. 
- These should be filtered from the analysis, because in a study of currency movement, if it doesn't move then there is nothing more to be said. 

---
# Pre-processing: Keep currencies that change

- To filter out these currencies we use a statistic called [coefficient of variation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coefficient_of_variation):

$$
Coef Variation = \frac{\sigma}{\mu}
$$

--

- Measures standard deviation of currency relative to the mean. 
- For high means, we expect a currency to change more. 
- That is, relatively the standard deviation would be larger to consider it to be changing.

---

# Computing CV

### Strategy pivot to long form then group and summarize currency values

```{r}
# Compute coefficient of variation. We will only analyse 
# currencies that have changes substantially over this time.
cv <- function(x){
  sd(x)/mean(x)
}

rates_cv <- rates %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = -date, names_to = "currency") %>% 
  group_by(currency) %>% 
  summarise(cv = cv(value)) 
```

---
# Distrubtion of CV values

```{r cv-histogram, echo = FALSE}
rates_cv %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = cv)) +
    geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.01)
```

---
# Identify currencies with CVs below the first quantile

```{r low-quantile}
rates_stable <- rates_cv %>%
  filter(cv < quantile(cv, 0.25))
```

---

# Filter out low cv currencies using pivot and an anti join

```{r anti-low-cv}
rates_sub <- rates %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = -date, names_to = "currency") %>% 
  anti_join(rates_stable)
rates_sub
```

---
# Remove currencies that are not currencies

Some of the currencies ... aren't really currencies. Google these ones: XAG, XDR, XPT - what are they?

---
# Remove currencies that are not currencies

```{r}
# Remove non-currencies
rates_dropped <- rates_sub %>% 
  filter(!currency %in% c("ALL", "XAG", "XDR", "XPT"))
```

XAG is Gold
XPT is Platinum
XDR is special drawing rights

---
# Standardize the currencies

To examine overall trend regardless of actual USD cross rate, standardise the values to have mean 0 and standard deviation 1.


```{r scale-fun}
scale01 <- function(x) (x - mean(x)) / sd(x)
```

---
# Rescale all values to have standardised values

##  Use `group_by()` plus `mutate()`!

--
```{r rescale-rates}
rates_scaled <- rates_dropped %>%
  group_by(currency) %>% 
  mutate(value = scale01(value))
```

---
# Standardize the currencies

```{r currencies-standardized, out.width = "100%", echo = FALSE}
rates_scaled %>% 
    filter(currency %in% c("AUD", "EUR", "JPY")) %>% 
    ggplot(aes(x =  date, y = value)) + 
    geom_line() +
    facet_grid(~currency)
```

---
# Compute distances between all pairs of currencies

Euclidean distance is used to compute similarity between all pairs of currencies. 

$d_{ij} = \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{t}{(C_{1i}-C_{2i})^2}}$

---
# Compute distances between all pairs of currencies

We need to put our data back in wide form! And then turn it
into a matrix. 

```{r compute-dist-01}
rates_wide <- rates_scaled %>% 
    pivot_wider(id_cols = "date", names_from = "currency") %>%
    select(-date)

# compute distance between currencies, rows <--> columns 
rates_wide_t <- t(rates_wide)
```



---
# Use built in function to compute distance

```{r}
currency_dist <- as.matrix(dist(rates_wide_t, 
                             diag = TRUE, 
                             upper = TRUE))

currency_dist[1:5, 1:5]
```


---
# A note on distance matrices:

- A distance matrix is the inverse of an association matrix. 
- A distance matrix close to 0 means the pair are most similar. 
- For an association matrix far from zero means the pair are close. 
- Either can be used to generate a network. 

---
# Create network: Pivot data into long form, filter based on similarity

Here only the pairs of currencies who are closer than "4" to each other are kept. 

```{r}
distance_tbl <-  currency_dist %>% 
  as.data.frame() %>%
  rownames_to_column(var = "from_currency") %>% 
  pivot_longer(-from_currency, 
               names_to = "to_currency",
               values_to = "distance") %>% 
  filter(distance < 4 ) %>%
  filter(from_currency != to_currency)
```

---
# Create network: Gather data into long form, filter based on similarity

Here only the pairs of currencies who are closer than "4" to each other are kept. 

```{r show-zero-tbl}
distance_tbl
```


---
# Network laid out

.left-code[
```{r currency-network, eval = FALSE}
set.seed(10052016)
ggplot(data = distance_tbl, 
       aes(
         from_id = from_currency, 
         to_id = to_currency
         )) +
  geom_net(
    size = 3, 
    labelon = TRUE, 
    repel = TRUE,
    ecolour = "grey60",
    fontsize = 3,
    ealpha = 0.5
    ) +
    theme_net() +
    theme(
      legend.position = "bottom"
      )
```

# Your turn

- Make a plot of the AUD vs the SGD (using the standardised units). Do they look like they are trending together as suggested by the network?
- Try out the remaining lab exercises

# A note on presenting your project

- We suggest making recording a group presentation with zoom, and uploading to youtube as an unlisted video
- Time limit of 5 minutes
- You can use basic software like Quicktime to trim the starts and ends of the videos
- I will post more details on how to post videos onto youtube soon.
